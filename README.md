## sfdx-sobjects-lwc-typings
Node.js library to generate LWC typings for SObjects

Based on @salesforce/salesforcedx-sobjects-faux-generator from Salesforce Extensions for VS Code (https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/tree/develop/packages/salesforcedx-sobjects-faux-generator)

### Why this library was created:
Problem: SFDX CLI only generates LWC TypeScript typings based on Apex classes. Typings for SObjects are generated by "Salesforce Extensions for VS Code" plug-in.
I extracted the relevant code to a separate library, so we can use it outside VSCode (in CI/CD or other IDEs).

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  SObjectCategory,
  SObjectTransformerFactory
} from "sfdx-sobjects-lwc-typings";

const cmdEmitter: EventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

const transformer = await SObjectTransformerFactory.create(
    cmdEmitter,
    SObjectCategory.ALL
);

const result = await transformer.transform();
```
